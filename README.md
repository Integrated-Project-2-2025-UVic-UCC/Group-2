In recent years, society has shown a growing tendency toward seeking a comfortable lifestyle and that implies efficiency, and automation not only in industry but particularly in day-to-day life tasks. For this to come into fruition, a very close link exists between that and the increasing integration of technology, especially robotics used to simplify tasks, reduce physical effort, and enhance processes. Robots are no longer considered to be confined to industrial environments, since they are progressively being adapted for personal, domestic, and service-oriented applications.  

The aim of this robot works in this direction, his purpose is to carry the stuff for you.
